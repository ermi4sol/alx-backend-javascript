# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and utilizing various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, specifically arrays, typed arrays, sets, maps, and weak maps. The goal is to master the usage of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays, along with the implementation and characteristics of different data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays effectively.
- Understand and implement typed arrays.
- Utilize the Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures.

## Requirements

- All files must be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**, **Visual Studio Code**.
- Ensure all files end with a new line.
- A **README.md** file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- All JavaScript files should use the `.js` extension.
- Code will be tested using **Jest** and the command `npm run test`.
- Code must pass lint checks using **ESLint**.
- Code needs to pass all tests and lint checks. Verify by running `npm run full-test`.
- All functions must be exported.
